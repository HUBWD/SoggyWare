## Execution
Here is the code in `loadstring`:
```lua
loadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HUBWD/SoggyWare/main/loaded.lua")()
```
**If you are unsure how to install, read this first [link](https://github.com/HUBWD/Welcome/blob/main/install.md "link")** 
## Information
I ended up doing this script in 3 hours and I must spend 1 hour writing it, this ***cracked*** was made on 12/29/2022 at 07:06 am (Brazil Time Zone)

## Explanation
> Look, it wasn't difficult to get everything, since they try to use an *Anti-HttpSpy*, but it fails in Interface (Because for some reason it only works in standard functions for example: printuiconsole, print, warn, writefile and so on) .

After getting all the links, it was simple to separate what was important and what wasnt, I just saved all the links and the function in the folder called [codes found](https://github.com/HUBWD/SoggyWare/tree/ main/codes%20found "codes found")

##### What would this be?
I don't know if they tried to defend themselves, but they hide the script in the last line of the site, in another explanation too, they use the `--[[message]]` system so that the `loadstring` just reads the script. In the files that I saved, the way they did this.
